# **CS 315 Group Project Summer 2023**

## **The Project**

> This project is for the NAU CS 315 Web development course using React, NodeJS, and database - MongoDB at the time of writing, however MySQL is the alternative. <br><br> The product produced is to be a retail website where sellers can post their items to be sold on a storefront, while the consumer can purchase multiple sellers items at once. The idea came from a negotiation free, retail-style image of Craigslist.
